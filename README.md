# Elderfield — v2.7.1 Save & Progress Pass

A browser-playable top-down fantasy adventure built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## New in v2.7.1
- browser save/load using local storage
- Continue Adventure, New Journey, and Delete Save actions on the start card
- autosave while traveling, plus shrine and dungeon progress saves
- debug report now includes save availability, last save time, save reason, and checkpoint
- build/version badge moved to the **top-right** so it no longer fights the message box
- layout tightened to keep the page cleaner and reduce annoying browser scroll on desktop

## Save behavior
- the game stores progress in your browser
- saves include: hearts, rupees, relics, dungeon state, owned weapons, active weapon, sword level, area, and checkpoint
